This project is based on the 10 Heurisitcs for user interface design. First of all, we were asked to select 7 of them and create a usability assessment on a well known website. Secondly, we were asked to task two people to do the same three jobs on said website, but do not tell them how to do it. Then, we were asked to prototype our version of the website, although it did not have to big changes, only changes we thought nessessary. Finally we were asked to concluded the lot.
