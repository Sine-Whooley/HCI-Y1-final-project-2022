<strong>We were asked to 'Suggest ways to improve two interface issues' from the website we were examining. Not a full redesign, just minor tweaks.  While examining the giant corporation that is Amazon and its website, I found very minor cosmetic things I would change. I have made examples of them below.</strong>

<li> The second change I would make is the layout of the search-bar area.
	<br><strong>1.</strong> Move all personal bits like - 'hello SÃ­ne', 'Delivering to..' and the flag to the left. 
	<br><strong>2.</strong> Split Accounts & Lists - By splitting the accounts and the lists section at the top of the drop down menu wont be too cluttered. As is, to view the whole drop down menu, you must scroll down the page. 
	This is a waste of user time. By changing this, you wont get a headaches trying to find the list of info you need, thus allowing you to see clearly what you are looking for instead of being overwhelmed with information.<br>
