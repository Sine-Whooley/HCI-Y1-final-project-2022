<h2>
	So what have I learned about the website?
</h2>
<p>
	There are a few things I learned through out this process. When it comes to heuristics, Amazon has covered almost every aspect perfectly, displaying professinalism to its customers. Everything is easy to find, and clearly laid out, although slightly cluttered at times. The #6 Heuristic, 'Recognitions rather than Recall' is what I really appreciate in a shopping website as I often forget what I have been looking at but, at the same time I would like to purchase it anyway. 
	Amazon has covered this aspect many times over with the 'Recently viewed',  'Based on search history' etc.
<br>
	I now know the importance of the 10 Heuristics for a website. Without abiding by these simple rules, the experience you would have would be unpleasent to say the least.

			How could it be improved? 
		</h2>
		<p>
			If you recall what I displayed in the prototype section, I dont believe amazon has much to improve on, only the cosmetic side of it. Although being slightly to cluttered, this can easily be improved by rearranging the top bar of the website. <br>
			The website colour should be similar to its app, with bright blue colours as the theme running through it.

		What have I learned about interaction design during project? 
	</h2>
	<p>
		I have learned the importance of design during this process. For example, how, if there was no 'delete' button, customers will no longer use the website. How, icons are a nice touch to break up all the writing in the website. <br> Layout is a very important factor. You would not want to overwhelem your customer with all the information on page one, and on page two, have it blank.<br> An exapmle of this would be, this website. My Home page is short, but the Assessment and Test pages have loads of information on them. Giving the user as uncorfortable experience while reading.
