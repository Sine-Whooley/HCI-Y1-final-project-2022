As I began looking and the giant corporation that is Amazon, I came to the conclusion that they deserve the recognition they get. Although the cosmetic side of the website, eg the colour scheme is too to dark for my specific taste, it was hard to fault other than that. Below are a few questions I thought of for my heuristics test and if I could not find a fault, I gave 2 examples of good heuritics associated with the 7 heuristics chosen

<h3>
#1 Visability of systems
</h3>
<strong>
- Good:
</strong>
You are notified about changes made to your basket along the way. You can see the total amount of items in the basket by looking at the basket-shaped icon on the top right hand corner, or by the noification on the middle of the screen
<br><br>
<strong>
- Bad:
</strong>
Depending on how you chose to look at an item on amazon depend on weather or not you can see the trail it takes to get you there.

<h3>
#2 Match between system and real world
</h3>
<strong>
- Good:
</strong>
Amazon takes the blame for any errors that may have occured and explains in a clear and concise way how to proceed. They also have a pet sitting at the bottom of the screen so. It happens a little too often though
<br><br>
<strong>
- Good:
</strong>
The icons used in 'Your Account' and throughout the website is relevant to what you need to do there.

<h3>
#3 User control & freedom
</h3>
<strong>
- Good:
</strong>
People make mistakes, and theres no exception when it comes to online shopping. Thankfully Amazon has you covered. If you accidently added an item to your basket, you can delete / save for later when you are viewing the basket or while you are checking out.
<br><br>
<strong>
- Bad:
</strong>
Unfortunately, when I tried to order an item without an account, I couldnt. The website promps you to log in or make an account.

<h3>
#4 Cosistancy & Standards
</h3>
<strong>
- Good:
</strong>
The standards of products are watched and commented buy shoppers in the 'reviews' section.
While searching for items, Amazon also gives you many recommendations. For example, 'Amazon's Choice' and 
<br><br>
<strong>
- Bad(ish):
</strong>
As mentioned, the colour scheme is not a preference for me at all. I personally believe the website should imitate the mobile app, being light/bright blue. But the button inconsistancy is also poor. The CTA's (Call to action) prompt buttons are all different colours, giving it a rushed feel, which may also confuse the user as to which are more important than others, if there are any.

<h3>
#6 Recognition rather than recall
</h3>
<strong>
- Good:
</strong>
Your browsing history is at the bottom of the page allowing you to view what you have recently been looking at. 
<br><br>
<strong>
- Good:
</strong>
Amazon allows you to 'Save for later' items in a file that you may want, but are not ready to purchase

<h3>
#7 Flexibility & efficiency of use
</h3>
<strong>
- Good:
</strong>
There is a bar of shortcuts under the search bar. This allows you to quickly connect to a different part of amazon eg, Prime, Kindle, Your Business Account. 
<br><br>
<strong>
- Good:
</strong>
If, after going throug the entire process of ordering something and you still did it incorrectly, amazin allows you to cancel order, or alter it while in the 'review your order section'
